      <description>It makes sense to have a now page. Earlier I used to have disclaimer in the About section of the site stating that the page has slower updates than happenings of life. Unless updates, this page is what I am doing. For the About website, please have a look at the colophon
Today is 20th July, 2020.
Yesterday marked the completion of four months of staying in. After IITB asked students to evacuate the campus, I returned to my place in Rajkot, Gujarat.</description>

      <description>Whatever is limited can be traded 1/ &amp;#8853; 1/ Scarcity being the extereme case of limited-ness .
This human trait of finding value in what is limited has primal roots. Ancient trade began when people saw value in shells, cowrie money. ‚äï  Cowrie trading in old Kolkata (‡¶ï‡¶≤‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶§‡¶æ)    People collected those shells from wherever they can and stored it for future trades. They were passed as heirlooms initially to store the rarity and once it was accepted as a medium of exchange, they were traded for good and collected as a store of value.</description>

      <description>Henri Bergson describes humor as a critique on the mechanistic. We joke on the attributes that we find are mechanical, rigid, repetitive, and those whcih make us perish during the evolution. In an essay (vide, Emily Herring) he points out that play on words makes us laugh because it shows the rigidity of the language. We expect the literal and get the figurative or something from other dimension (non-literal). Puns, some poor jokes are manifestation of the comment on the mechanical.</description>

      <title>Resources to hack the research workflow</title>

      <description>ChangeLog: 20-Sep-2020: Added python script to highlight pdf annotations Added Zettelkasten based foam-bubble 29-Jul-2020: Added connectedpapers.com 14-Jul-2020: Added Tiddlywiki 14-Mar-2020: Highly.co status as defunct. Twitter acquired highly.co (https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/twitter-highly/) 19-August-2019: Made the list The list contains a free softwares that aids in conducting research systematically. I believe that a document once read, a video once watched should be documented and stored systematically. Since consuming a stimulating piece of writing forms multiple connections in a researcher&amp;rsquo;s head, the storage system should not only store the documents and it&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts, but also should store the connections it has once formed.</description>

      <description>Summary&amp;ndash;The article &amp;#8853; The article is originally published in Aeon by Emily Herring   talks about the necessary conditions of comedy (implied to laughter) as per Henri Bergson&amp;rsquo;s leitmotiv of humor. It begins with Henri&amp;rsquo;s three conditions essential for laughter to emerge: humans only laugh at human-like attributes, emotions are foe of laughter, and laughter needs a social echo. The article then takes a steep jump in time where Bergson&amp;rsquo;s discovery of letimotiv of laughter is described.</description>

      <description>Hope is lost. People are scared of the unknown virus, uncertain about what is to come, and are scared of deaths. People lost faith in the government /1 &amp;#8853; 1/ From managing health infrastructure to managing migrant workers  . State governments, although are pulling all-nighters and trying their best, are failing in the face of calamity. ‚äï  Amabie  Amabie is a yokai with three legs, a body with scales and a beaked face.</description>

      <description>IDC completed 50 years in 2019. The celebration was ceremonious. Incidentally, I re-joined IDC as a PhD student with Prof Girish. I thought of contributing to the celebration by analysing research contributed by IDC to different domains. It started out as an idea during one of my conversations with Prof Anirudha.
The post is structured as follows:
 Why to look at the history of research? Ways to look at the research of an organisation?</description>

      <description>Context or where this blog comes from? June 26th, 2018 is when I defended my Master&amp;rsquo;s thesis. The topic was chosen with a hope to do something practically impactful in the domain of behaviour change. So, I chose both of my projects (MDP2 and MDP3) in the domain of behaviour change /1 &amp;#8853; MDP = Masters Design Project. MDP2 was &#34;Design interventions for improving handwashing behaviour; MDP3 was &#34;Design interventions for raising awareness of sound pollution&#34;</description>

      <description>All models are wrong, but some are useful  George Box    Designers and artists make their portfolios to showcase their work. Pretty obvious. Websites are the digital form of showcasing the work. Also pretty obvious. However, recruiters see the web-portfolio as a process model of a designer. What is a designer&amp;rsquo;s ethos, what are the layers which she operates in, and what type of work does she likes to produce.</description>

      <description>‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§• // ‡™µ‡´ç‡™Ø‡™∞‡´ç‡™• // vyarth (in vain) We called it Vyartha because this is the feeling that made us compose the book. It is an existential story of one Utc Singhal who did not fear the emotions and looked through the reality to find deeper meanings. He is a man of questions, and a courage to find answers. He does not shy away from the medium or the message. This is a story of Malay who was always curious about what goes in the mind of Utc.</description>

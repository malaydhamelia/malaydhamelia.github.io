      <description>Two years back around the same time, I had written about how Amit Trivedi and ARR are the faces of Indian modern music. With recent developments about Sonu Nigam&amp;rsquo;s call out about Nepotism and AT releasing &amp;lsquo;Songs of faith&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Songs of dance&amp;rsquo; on YT, it becomes imperative to think about modern music in India; only with a stronger backbone than the previous post on similar topic.
Zygmunt Bauman has done some work on the modernity.</description>

      <description>With a stimulating read from the Commonweal magazine detailing out the suicide plan of the west, and with a micro-worry about the effect of rainlessness in the central and south-central India, this playlist of A.R Rahman gave a sense of warmth. Reminiscing about his older discography and single pieces like Jiya jale, Tu hi re Thok de killi, Chinnamma Chilakamma, I could see a pattern of experimentation. Radical in his youth, his older songs still resonate with me.</description>

      <description>Abstract Sonic environment consisting of various sounds ranging from music and natural sounds to artificial sounds is an integral part of any geography. It is a reflection of people living in the location as well as an influencer of culture in that location. To assess the perception of a person or people of context offered by that location, a soundscape assessment is performed that majorly involve likert based questions for pleasantness, annoyance, appropriateness and so forth.</description>

      <description>Abstract Hands come in contact with a variety of surfaces and fluids. This makes hands, a primary vector of many communicable diseases. Acute diarrhoeal diseases, acute respiratory diseases can be prevented by a simple habit of washing hands at appropriate times. This habit is very essential for households of urban slums and rural areas since the surrounding is an ideal hotbed for pathogens. The effect of hand washing is acknowledged by medical experts and the world health organisation (WHO).</description>

      <description>Overview Preventing epidemic from occurring and spreading is the one of the major motives of any government health ward. Collecting information about the epidemics is done via manual reporting in the current state. Information about epidemics require faster ways of reporting to take actions and prevent it from spreading. We leveraged the increased usage of smartphone to increase a faster reporting of epidemics in a city.
We conducted user studies to understand the existing flow of information between entities ranging from the epidemic cell to local foot soldiers over a period of two weeks to design and develop an application that will allow faster reporting with very less cognitive load on the foot soldiers.</description>

      <description>Overview The advent of smart cities has increased the demand for agile and effective governance. This paper presents a prototype at the proof of concept stage, called “Pulse”. The system comprises of – a mobile app for citizens to submit feedback, a web dashboard for district administrators and government bodies to push close-ended questions based on locality, gender, age group and time, and a network of eddystone beacons that pushes close-ended questions about urban spaces, creating a hyperlocal crowdsensing framework in the Indian context.</description>

      <title>User study: Technological opportunities to support kirana stores</title>

      <description>Overview While modern trade has been growing in India over the last 25 years, small grocery stores (also known as kirana shops) continue to have over 90% of the market share. An interesting practice in these stores is that they provide credit to their customers, which is a major draw for some of their loyal customers. However, this practice often leads to a crunch of working capital for the shopkeeper. Could these traditional credit practices be better supported with use of technology?</description>

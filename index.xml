      <description>Go-Hu-go The website is build using Hugo and Tuftesque. Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. I have used Grav (2017-2019) and WordPress (2013-2017) before switching over to Hugo. Grav being a flat-file CMS, had tremendous build times as I used goDaddy servers to host. The compilation itself took around 30s to 1m. But the major drawbacks were not related to effeciency of compilation, but were functional. One, the pipeline to git was pretty complicated.</description>

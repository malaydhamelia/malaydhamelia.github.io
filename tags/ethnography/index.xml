      <description>Overview While modern trade has been growing in India over the last 25 years, small grocery stores (also known as kirana shops) continue to have over 90% of the market share. An interesting practice in these stores is that they provide credit to their customers, which is a major draw for some of their loyal customers. However, this practice often leads to a crunch of working capital for the shopkeeper. Could these traditional credit practices be better supported with use of technology?</description>

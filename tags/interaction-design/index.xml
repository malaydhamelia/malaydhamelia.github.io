      <description>Abstract Hands come in contact with a variety of surfaces and fluids. This makes hands, a primary vector of many communicable diseases. Acute diarrhoeal diseases, acute respiratory diseases can be prevented by a simple habit of washing hands at appropriate times. This habit is very essential for households of urban slums and rural areas since the surrounding is an ideal hotbed for pathogens. The effect of hand washing is acknowledged by medical experts and the world health organisation (WHO).</description>

      <description>Overview Preventing epidemic from occurring and spreading is the one of the major motives of any government health ward. Collecting information about the epidemics is done via manual reporting in the current state. Information about epidemics require faster ways of reporting to take actions and prevent it from spreading. We leveraged the increased usage of smartphone to increase a faster reporting of epidemics in a city.
We conducted user studies to understand the existing flow of information between entities ranging from the epidemic cell to local foot soldiers over a period of two weeks to design and develop an application that will allow faster reporting with very less cognitive load on the foot soldiers.</description>

      <description>Overview The advent of smart cities has increased the demand for agile and effective governance. This paper presents a prototype at the proof of concept stage, called “Pulse”. The system comprises of – a mobile app for citizens to submit feedback, a web dashboard for district administrators and government bodies to push close-ended questions based on locality, gender, age group and time, and a network of eddystone beacons that pushes close-ended questions about urban spaces, creating a hyperlocal crowdsensing framework in the Indian context.</description>

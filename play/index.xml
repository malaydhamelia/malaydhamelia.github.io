      <description>व्यर्थ // વ્યર્થ // vyarth (in vain) We called it Vyartha because this is the feeling that made us compose the book. It is an existential story of one Utc Singhal who did not fear the emotions and looked through the reality to find deeper meanings. He is a man of questions, and a courage to find answers. He does not shy away from the medium or the message. This is a story of Malay who was always curious about what goes in the mind of Utc.</description>

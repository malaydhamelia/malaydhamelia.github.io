      <description>ChangeLog: 29-Jul-2020: Added connectedpapers.com 14-Jul-2020: Added Tiddlywiki 14-Mar-2020: Highly.co status as defunct. Twitter acquired highly.co (https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/twitter-highly/) 19-August-2019: Made the list I am a clumsy being. I read a lot of things without organising them and hence I forget things adn remember it in fragments. Hence, I made a list of research online-tools that help researchers that help in conducting research systematically. The list is, I think well tagged, and sortable.</description>

      <description>Historically, humans have endured several epidemics and pandemics. What makes the CoVID 19 epidemic different is, it&amp;rsquo;s co-existence with the information age. What are some changes that we have seen? The age where we live between the concepts of technocracy and technopoly as explained by Neil Postman in his book Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. I bring this here as this idea sparked from the conversations one catches daily, and the observed unusuality of it in recent times.</description>

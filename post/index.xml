      <description>Henri Bergson describes humor as a critique on the mechanistic. We joke on the attributes that we find are mechanical, rigid, repetitive, and those whcih make us perish during the evolution. In an essay (vide, Emily Herring) he points out that play on words makes us laugh because it shows the rigidity of the language. We expect the literal and get the figurative or something from other dimension (non-literal). Puns, some poor jokes are manifestation of the comment on the mechanical.</description>

      <description>ChangeLog: 29-Jul-2020: Added connectedpapers.com 14-Jul-2020: Added Tiddlywiki 14-Mar-2020: Highly.co status as defunct. Twitter acquired highly.co (https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/twitter-highly/) 19-August-2019: Made the list  I am a clumsy being. I read a lot of things without organising them and hence I forget things adn remember it in fragments. Hence, I made a list of research online-tools that help researchers that help in conducting research systematically. The list is, I think well tagged, and sortable.</description>

      <description>Context or where this blog comes from? June 26th, 2018 is when I defended my Master&amp;rsquo;s thesis. The topic was chosen with a hope to do something practically impactful in the domain of behaviour change. So, I chose both of my projects (MDP2 and MDP3) in the domain of behaviour change /1 &amp;#8853; MDP = Masters Design Project. MDP2 was &#34;Design interventions for improving handwashing behaviour; MDP3 was &#34;Design interventions for raising awareness of sound pollution&#34;</description>

      <description>ChangeLog: 29-Jul-2020: Added connectedpapers.com 14-Jul-2020: Added Tiddlywiki 14-Mar-2020: Highly.co status as defunct.

So, I chose both of my projects (MDP2 and MDP3) in the domain of behaviour change /1 &amp;#8853; MDP = Masters Design Project. MDP2 was &#34;Design interventions for improving handwashing behaviour; MDP3 was &#34;Design interventions for raising awareness of sound pollution&#34;</description>

      <description>IDC completed 50 years in 2019. The celebration was ceremonious. Incidentally, I re-joined IDC as a PhD student with Prof Girish. I thought of contributing to the celebration by analysing research contributed by IDC to different domains. It started out as an idea during one of my conversations with Prof Anirudha.

      <description>Context or where this blog comes from? June 26th, 2018 is when I defended my Master&amp;rsquo;s thesis. The topic was chosen with a hope to do something practically impactful in the domain of behaviour change.

MDP2 was &#34;Design interventions for improving handwashing behaviour; MDP3 was &#34;Design interventions for raising awareness of sound pollution&#34;</description>

      <description>IDC completed 50 years in 2019. The celebration was ceremonious. Incidentally, I re-joined IDC as a PhD student with Prof Girish.

MDP2 was &#34;Design interventions for improving handwashing behaviour; MDP3 was &#34;Design interventions for raising awareness of sound pollution&#34;</description>

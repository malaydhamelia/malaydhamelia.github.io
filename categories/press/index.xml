      <description>Recently I was introduced to this nearly cult anthology produced by David Fincher (producer/director of some of my favourites &amp;ndash; Mindhunter, House of Cards, Fight Club, Alien, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Case of Benjamin Button) called Love, Death, and Robots (LD+R, in short). The anthology is a potpourri of animated stories of varying length and varying animation styles by various artists. Thanks to Vajra for introducing this to me!</description>

      <description>Whatever is limited can be traded 1/ &amp;#8853; 1/ Scarcity being the extereme case of limited-ness .
This human trait of finding value in what is limited has primal roots. Ancient trade began when people saw value in shells, cowrie money. ⊕  Cowrie trading in old Kolkata (কলকাতা)    People collected those shells from wherever they can and stored it for future trades. They were passed as heirlooms initially to store the rarity and once it was accepted as a medium of exchange, they were traded for good and collected as a store of value.</description>

      <description>Recently I was introduced to this nearly cult anthology produced by David Fincher (producer/director of some of my favourites &amp;ndash; Mindhunter, House of Cards, Fight Club, Alien, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Case of Benjamin Button) called Love, Death, and Robots (LD+R, in short). The anthology is a potpourri of animated stories of varying length and varying animation styles by various artists. Thanks to Vajra for introducing this to me!</description>
